    <h1>Optimizing Mitochondria GenomeAssembly And Annotation WithSkim Sequencing Data</h1>
    
    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>Write the absitact here</p>
    Genome sequencing and genome assembly are the computational process of converting the sequence composition of the gene within the cell of an organism in a human readable form. Mitochondria is an important genome in the cell and there is a need to study this genome for various reasons.
    The process of determining the order of bases A,G,T,C in the genome is known as genome sequencing.While sequencing the genome the original genome is separated into huge number of small parts known as reads and the end results of sequencing is a huge pool of reads(strings of A,G,T,C).These reads must be assembled back in a computer so that a biologist can identify and annotate the functionality of it.
    There are several techniques were developed to sequence the genome,
    the modern approach is next generation sequencing.
    Ilumina sequencing is one of the broadly used next generation sequencing method and this method produce large number of high precision sequencing  short reads whereas other older methods produce longer reads.So the computational complexity of assembling back this large amount of read is high but cost efficient.
    <br>Here we mainly discuss on low coverage sequencing data assembly.The sequencing data consist of multiple copies of same genome in low coverage data the number of copies are relatively lower than high coverage data.
    There are several problems faced by biologists while and after assembling genome like low accurate assembly of genome and slow assembly process. In this report we address these problems and proposing optimal solution to these problems, in addition to these generic problems this project also focus on mitochondria genome extraction from whole genome sequencing data and working with skim sequenced low coverage data.
    Before developing the pipeline for genome assembly the existing tools for genome assembly were studied.This report contain a review of those tools and in future it was planned to recommend biologists optimal tools for their type of assembly. The implementation plan and the steps done to assemble  \textbf{Cinnamomum verum(Ceylon cinnamon tree)} genome is discussed here.Finally an implementation plan for developing a new pipeline for optimize mitochondria genome assembly and annotation is stated.
