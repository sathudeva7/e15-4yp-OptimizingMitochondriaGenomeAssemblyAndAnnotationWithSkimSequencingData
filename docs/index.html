    <h1>Optimizing Mitochondria GenomeAssembly And Annotation WithSkim Sequencing Data</h1>
    
    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    
    Genome sequencing and genome assembly are the computational process of converting the sequence composition of the gene within the cell of an organism in a human readable form. Mitochondria is an important genome in the cell and there is a need to study this genome for various reasons.
    The process of determining the order of bases A,G,T,C in the genome is known as genome sequencing.While sequencing the genome the original genome is separated into huge number of small parts known as reads and the end results of sequencing is a huge pool of reads(strings of A,G,T,C).These reads must be assembled back in a computer so that a biologist can identify and annotate the functionality of it.
    There are several techniques were developed to sequence the genome,
    the modern approach is next generation sequencing.
    Ilumina sequencing is one of the broadly used next generation sequencing method and this method produce large number of high precision sequencing  short reads whereas other older methods produce longer reads.So the computational complexity of assembling back this large amount of read is high but cost efficient.
    <br>Here we mainly discuss on low coverage sequencing data assembly.The sequencing data consist of multiple copies of same genome in low coverage data the number of copies are relatively lower than high coverage data.
    There are several problems faced by biologists while and after assembling genome like low accurate assembly of genome and slow assembly process. In this report we address these problems and proposing optimal solution to these problems, in addition to these generic problems this project also focus on mitochondria genome extraction from whole genome sequencing data and working with skim sequenced low coverage data.
    Before developing the pipeline for genome assembly the existing tools for genome assembly were studied.This report contain a review of those tools and in future it was planned to recommend biologists optimal tools for their type of assembly. The implementation plan and the steps done to assemble  <b>Cinnamomum verum(Ceylon cinnamon tree)</b> genome is discussed here.Finally an implementation plan for developing a new pipeline for optimize mitochondria genome assembly and annotation is stated.

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    Optimizing Mitochondria Genome Assembly And Annotation With Skim Sequencing Data describes a research field concentrated with the application
    done to assemble a mitochondria genome and analyze the pros and cons of it to find an optimal mitochondria genome. Mitochondria are structures 
    within cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. A genome is an organismâ€™s complete set of genetic instructions.
    Each genome contains all of the information needed to build that organism and allow it to grow and develop. Mitochondria genes and genomes are 
    the most important genomic data for animal phylogeny and species identification.
    <br>This assembly is to find an efficient procedure to identify the optimal set of mitochondria genome data from skim sequencing data and assemble, 
    annotate those data to form a complete mitochondria genome. The development in bioinformatics methods made it possible to extract specific genome from 
    datasets and assemble a whole genome with these low coverage data (20-30Gb of data). Bioinformatics methods are very cost-effective when compared to the
    traditional methods; this is why skim sequencing data was used in this project rather than extract mitochondria genome at lab before hand. There are
    several assembly pipelines suggested for assembling genome tools for mitochondrial genomeassembly. 
    <br>DNA Sequencing is the process of determining the order of nucleotide bases A, G, T,C in a DNA molecule. A knowledge of Genome Sequence is 
    necessary to understand what a genome contains and make use of a combination of computer analysis and experimentation, with the primary aims of locating
    genes and determining their functions. Along with that,the genome sequence is also important for the understanding of how the genome is expressed. 
    Over the last 30 years, several molecular biology techniques were developed to sequence the DNA. Also, the objective of genome sequencing differentiates 
    over the years.
    
    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <h4>Design Overview</h4>
    This chapter covers how the work flow of the mitochondrial genome assembly optimization is planned. From the literature review we could find 
    the tools that are dedicated for mitochondrial genome assembly. We then analyze the tools by reading and short listed some of them for experimental analysis.
    Genome assembly remains a challenging computational problem, the next-generation sequencing technologies which generate a greater amount of data and 
    make the assembly process more complex. There is a huge demand for a pipeline that will assemble a genome quickly and accurately. 
    In this next-generation sequencing, the results are short reads, so we mainly focused on the tools that do short read assembly of mitochondria genome.
